    <article id="slide_5" data-slideId="5"><p>American history is Indigenous history. It begins with the deep history of the land and its peoples as they existed long before the arrival of Europeans. The first parties of English – most of them professional soldiers – made coastal landings and probed the dozens of rivers that led inland. They claimed possession of these spaces according to legal arguments that gave ownership of empty land to whomever discovered and occupied it. But they soon discovered that the land was not empty. The Indigenous name of the place they called ‘Virginia’ is Tsenacommacah: the densely inhabited land.</p>

<article id="slide_6" data-slideId="6"><p>The Indigenous landscape was more than a homeland: it was a site of creation. For the coastal Algonquian it was the Dawnland, for the Haudenosaunee it was Turtle Island – the place where everything had its beginning and its being. The land was a cultural and moral space, infused with fundamental beliefs, and overlayered with stories that were enacted, remembered, and shared among kin and with Europeans. The land was political. Haudenosaunee oral tradition drew the land and its history together in the story of the formation of the Great League of Peace, and where Deganawidah taught Hiawatha the rituals of the condolence ceremony. As the Onondaga diplomat Canasatego declared at a treaty council in 1744, ‘our Ancestors came out of this very Ground, and their Children have remained here ever since’.</p>
</article>
<article id="slide_7" data-slideId="7"><p>Indigenous peoples were map-makers, but these maps were carried in the mind and then sketched with charcoal on hide or bark, or drawn with a stick on soft soil; at other times they were gestural, using the hand as an approximation of a region and its key points of settlement. Europeans copied these maps, which allow us to glimpse the ways in which Indigenous communities saw themselves in relation to Europeans. The famous Catawba deerskin map portrayed two contrasting ways of being on the land: the villages and towns of the Catawba are represented as a network of circles connected by paths, while the colonial city of Charlestown is rendered as a grid system of streets. The relative size of circles (a sacred shape in Indigenous culture) denotes the importance and power of each nation; the paths linking them represent connections of kinship, trade and alliance.</p>
</article>
<article id="slide_8" data-slideId="8"><p>Haudenosaunee translates as the ‘whole house’, and their homelands were conceived as a metaphorical Longhouse with ‘doors’ facing east and west. The Seneca guarded the western door and the Mohawk the eastern one that faced toward the British. Between them were the Cayuga, Onondaga and the Oneida. The longhouse and its nations are represented on the Hiawatha Belt representation of the Confederacy gathered together under the Great Law of Peace, and a graphic depiction of the actual position of the homeland of each nation in relation to the others. The central image of a white pine symbolises the tree of peace around which the nations are gather, and the location of the central council fire at Onondaga.</p>
</article>
<article id="slide_9" data-slideId="9"><p>British mapmakers took care in noting the positions of each nation and territorial extent of the Confederacy as a whole. In John Mitchell’s map of the British and French territories in North America, the label ‘Six Nations or Iroquois’ cuts across Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and north of the Great Lakes. Mitchell also identified the Haudenosaunee’s much smaller original homeland Irocoisia, centred on Lake Champlain.</p>
</article>
<article id="slide_10" data-slideId="10"><p>Yet this was not a wholly peaceful landscape: in the early seventeenth century the Haudenosaunee carried out campaigns against neighbouring nations, seeking captives and access to new hunting lands. In 1657, a missionary observed that the Iroquois homelands contained ‘more foreigners than natives of the country’. For the British, the Haudenosaunee were like themselves: an expanding commercial and military power that brought other nations under their control and, as allies of the Crown, into Britain’s imperial network. This myth of ‘Iroquois empire’ was used by the British to bolster their own power in interior spaces where Indigenous nations were fully sovereign.</p>
</article>
<article id="slide_11" data-slideId="11"><p>The United Colonies emerged as a new power in 1775 and sought diplomatic relations with the Haudenosaunee. However, the peoples of the longhouse divided over the conflict between Britain and her colonies: the Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga, and the Cayuga remained allied to the Crown via the Covenant Chain. In 1779, George Washington planned a massive military operation ‘directed against the hostile tribes of the six nations of Indians, with their associated and adherents’. He continued that it was necessary to complete ‘the total destruction and devastation of their settlements’.</p>
</article>
<article id="slide_12" data-slideId="12"><p>The village worlds of the Haudenosaunee were broken apart. Thousands fled to the British stronghold at Fort Niagara, and the nations as whole experienced famine and displacement, their lands seized by the United States by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784). But the Iroquois did not vanish. Early American maps positioned them on the western edges expanded colonial spaces, not in reserved lands but in homelands that remain within the borders of New York state.</p>
