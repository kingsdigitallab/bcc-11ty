## Our homepage

Click on Story Quicklink below to go to the kinetic map.

You can control the map and accompanying text by scrolling down (or up to go back to an earlier point). The map display will change based on where you are in the text, and will show things relevant to that point in the Story.

Note that the Filters section is not yet functional.

The kinetic map Stories display is still a work in progress and what you see may be changed later. We hope this early chance to see it will generate useful feedback for us, so your comments at the workshop will be welcome.
