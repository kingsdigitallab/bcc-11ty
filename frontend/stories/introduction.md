Maps of early America do not tell the whole truth. While they frequently include scales and lines of latitude, their aim
was not geographical accuracy. For the British – the makers of the bulk of the maps used here – the aim was to
demonstrate actual and claimed possession of territory in North-eastern North America. In the process, mapmakers
captured information that reveal some of the deeper dynamics of the natural and human spaces of the known Continent. In
this map, we seek to bring these stories into greater relief, by illustrating the common worlds of early America.

Indigenous peoples are a constant presence in British maps. When mapmakers portrayed colonial possessions, they were in
fact drawing a coastal, interior, and Continental landscape of the homelands of Indigenous nations, who remained in
control of the majority of North American land and resources in 1780. While they drew colourful boundaries around
British colonies and imposed Anglophone names over wide expanses of paper and land, settlement was fragmented, small
scale, and confined to a narrow strip of the Atlantic coast. Given the relative imbalance of power, colonists tended to
resort to violence to defend claims to land, and war with neighbouring Indigenous nations was endemic. However, this
does not mean that the Northeast was defined by two separate and antagonistic worlds.
