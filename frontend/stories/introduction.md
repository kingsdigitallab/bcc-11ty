Maps of early America do not tell the whole truth. While they frequently include scales and lines of latitude, their aim was not geographical accuracy. For the British – the makers of the bulk of the maps used here – the aim was to demonstrate actual and claimed possession of territory in North-eastern North America. In the process, mapmakers captured information that reveals some of the deeper dynamics of the natural and human spaces of the known Continent. In this map, we seek to bring these stories to life by illustrating the _common worlds_ of early America.

**Settlement was fragmented and confined to a narrow strip of the Atlantic coast.**

Indigenous peoples are a constant presence in British maps. When mapmakers portrayed colonial possessions, they were in fact drawing a coastal, interior, and Continental landscape of Indigenous nations, who remained in control of the majority of North American land and resources in 1780. While they drew colourful boundaries around British colonies and placed English names over wide expanses of paper and territory, settlement was fragmented, small scale, and confined to a narrow strip of the Atlantic coast. Given the relative imbalance of power, colonists used violence to defend claims to land, and war with neighbouring Indigenous nations was endemic. However, this does not mean that the Northeast was defined by two separate and warring worlds.

**A world connected by diplomacy, alliance and movement.**

While the common worlds of Indigenous and British peoples were occasionally pushed apart by violence, they were also drawn together by pathways of connection, movement, diplomacy, alliance, and exchange. This model of inter-cultural relationship has been called a ‘middle ground’, and it existed in tension with a colonial impulse to establish and defend hard borders and boundaries, lines that excluded ‘outsiders’.
