American history is Indigenous history. It begins with the deep history of the land and its peoples as they existed long
before the arrival of Europeans. The first parties of English – most of them professional soldiers – made coastal
landings and probed the dozens of rivers that led inland. They claimed possession of these spaces according to legal
arguments that gave ownership of empty land to whomever discovered and occupied it. But they soon discovered that the
land was not empty. The Indigenous name of the place they called ‘Virginia’ is Tsenacommacah: the densely inhabited
land.
