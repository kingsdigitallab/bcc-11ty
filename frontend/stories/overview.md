For a long time, American history was the story of one nation and one Continent. From the Plymouth Colony to the Great Plains, history moved west where states appeared in spaces that were apparently empty. A story on this scale has relied on maps that show angular lines and borders, British colonies becoming American states. But those maps obscure the extent to which early colonists saw themselves as settled among nations.
